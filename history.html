    <h1>history</h1>

    <p>
      Indira Cinema opened its doors on July 8 1948 with the screening of <em>Sadharan Meye</em>.
      Indira became a cultural landmark in the community, particularly known for successfully screening films featuring Bengal's biggest stars, especially Mahanayak Uttam Kumar. Satyajit Ray's <em>Nayak</em> premiered at Indira.

    <h2>an art deco gem</h2>

    <p>
      You may have already noticed the many playful quirks of Indira Cinema's architecture.
      Formally, our architecture is in the art deco style.
      Indira is not the only example of this style in India or even in Kolkata, but it certainly is our favorite!
      The theater's exterior was designed by MK Ghosh and its original interiors by Khagen Roy.

    <h2>a labor of love</h2>

    <p>
      The Indira Cinema you see today was crafted slowly and with love. The cement tiles in the bar and the kathak room are original. The framed photos in the lobby are not simple photos but original "lobby cards"—little promotional booklets—that were traded between film distributors.
      Even the wooden panelling in the circular entrance was salvaged from the catwalk that ran above the original auditorium.
      If something catches your eye at Indira, ask us about it. The chances are that we have a tale to tell.
    </p>

    <h2>looking forward</h2>

    <p>
      After more than 75 years, Indira Cinema continues to represent not just a piece of Kolkata's cinematic history, but a living monument to the enduring power of cultural preservation.
      We are so excited to share Indira with you, and to continue its legacy as a vibrant cultural hub for years to come.
      Bring us your ideas, your enthusiasm, and your joy. We're finally ready.
