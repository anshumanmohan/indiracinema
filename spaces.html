        <h2>stalls</h2>
        <p>This large rectangular room was once the "stalls" section of Indira Cinema. It is now a versatile space with generous ceilings, its own street entrance, and men's and women's restrooms that are exclusively accessible from this room. It features an attached kitchenette and connects to ample semi-covered service areas.
        It can be used for large gatherings, performances, exhibitions, and parties.</p>
