    <h2>neighbourhood darling</h2>
    <p>
      Indira Cinema opened its doors on July 8 1948 with the screening of <em>Sadharan Meye</em>.
      Indira became a cultural landmark in the community, particularly known for successfully screening films featuring Bengal's biggest stars, especially Mahanayak Uttam Kumar. Satyajit Ray's <em>Nayak</em> premiered at Indira.

    <h2>art deco gem</h2>

    <p>
      You may have already noticed the many playful quirks of Indira Cinema's architecture.
      Formally, the building is in the art deco style.
      Indira is not the only example of this style in India or even in Kolkata, but it certainly is our favorite!
      The theater's exterior was designed by MK Ghosh and its interiors were by Khagen Roy.

    <h2>labour of love</h2>

    <p>
      The Indira you see today was crafted slowly and with care. The cement tiles in the bar and the kathak room are original. The framed photos in the lobby are not simple photos but untouched "lobby cards"—little promotional booklets—that were traded between film distributors.
      Even the wooden panelling in the circular entrance was salvaged from the catwalk that ran above the old auditorium.
      If something catches your eye at Indira, ask us about it. The chances are that we have a tale to tell!

    <h2>looking forward</h2>

    <p>
      We are so excited to reestablish Indira as a vibrant cultural hub.
      Cinema will always be our first love, but we're also interested in the arts more broadly.
      Bring us your ideas, your enthusiasm, and your joy. We're finally ready.
